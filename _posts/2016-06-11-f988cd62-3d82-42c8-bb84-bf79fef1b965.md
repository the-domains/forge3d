In the 1989 movie Dead Poets Society, the English teacher John Keating, played by Robin Williams, famously says: "Carpe Diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary." Later, this line was voted as the 95th greatest movie quote by the American Film Institute.\[8\] The NBC television series Community later satirized the movie in the episode "Introduction to Film," with John Michael Higgins playing a comedically eccentric version of Williams' character.
